# ttm-core-php

This is the core of a little architecture that was designed to create agile web applications, contemplating always the principles of low coupling and high cohesion. But The proposal also includes the creation of a simple structure, without excesses of complications and excesses stererotypes, thus providing a maintainable architecture and fast developement.

These reuseble components are based on Object-oriented Programming concepts, for implemetantion any design patterns: MVC, front controller, business objects, models entities, data transfer objects, facades, commands and data access object, registring services for view access (Rest + Json). So that the view layer (ui) and integration layer can be 'easily' changed, or and may also be another layer simultaneously. 

Why not use existing frameworks? 
The idea is a litte and so simple architecture, for the study and implementation of good programming practice (good ideas of solutions also) and to implement small projects. (nothing against frameworks)
